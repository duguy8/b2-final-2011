# User Story 3, Remove a Passenger from a Flight
# â€‹
# As a visitor
# When I visit a flight's show page
# Next to each passengers name I see a link or button to remove that passenger from that flight
# When I click on that link or button
# I'm returned to the flight's show page
# And I no longer see that passenger listed
